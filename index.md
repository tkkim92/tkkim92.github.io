## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="tkkim.jpeg">

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University where I work in the Network Research Laboratory advised by Professor [Wonjun Lee](http://netlab.korea.ac.kr/wlee/).
I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University in 2014.
My research focuses on WLAN, backscatter networks and Internet-of-Things to put novel and challenging wireless technologies to practical use.
Please send me an email to *tkkim92@korea.ac.kr* if you are interested in my research.
