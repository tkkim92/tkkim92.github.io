## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="tkkim.jpg">

I am a software engineer at Naver Cloud.
I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University under [Prof. Wonjun Lee](http://netlab.korea.ac.kr/wlee/).
I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University in 2014.
My research had focused on WLAN, backscatter networks and Internet-of-Things to put novel and challenging wireless technologies to practical use.
